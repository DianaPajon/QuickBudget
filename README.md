# QuickBudget

Hi, I'm Diana, I'm a programmer. This is my first side project, all the other stuff here is either work or school related.

## Objective

I want to make a simple budget app to control my expenses. It will have the following features:

  - It will work as an android app, and also as a web page.
  - You will be able to budget a new expense (google translate says it's right) by a quick access on the app icon.
  - The new expense screen will show some custom metrics, wich will be customizable by the user on the device itself (device-specific). 
  - It will synchronize itself with a server, but the mobile version will work offline.
  - It will be developed on a schedule (never PMd anything, so this will be the hardest part. The schedule will be kept in the file ROADMAP.md on this repo. It will work as a development blog also. (only the first section will me modified).
  - All documentation will be kept in english, that way i can practice a little. (native spanish speaker).

_This readme will be expanded as the project advances._
