/**
 * This package aims to contain an abstract description of the QuickBudget backend. Its main objective of  is to provide
 * a set of types that, when the endpoint and repositories are implemented, will work as the full implementation of the 
 * backend.
 * 
 * All types on this packaged aim to be self-contained. They depend only
 * on the java library, they will never depend on any package outside this package.
 * 
 * When completed this package will provide most of the backend actual code in an abstract 
 * manner, only missing the repositories and endpoints boilerplate code.
